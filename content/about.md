I am a computer software engineer, living in Italy, that enjoys hacking
on electronics, mechanics, 3d printing, programming microcontrollers and computers
in variuous languages.

I try to reserve a few hours on the weekend or an evening every week, for
working on personal projects and try new stuff.

This way I can stay up to date with technology and learn new things.

The articles in this blog, document the interesting thing I discovere during
my hackings.

Happy reading!
