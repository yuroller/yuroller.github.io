I am a computer software engineer, living in [Modena (Italy)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modena), working as a programmer mainly in C, C++, [Python](http://www.python.org), [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) programming languages, in industrial automation, voip software and biotech labs intruments industry. 

I enjoys hacking on electronics, mechanics, 3d printing, programming microcontrollers and computers end experimenting with various programming languages.

I try to reserve a few hours on the weekend or an evening every week, for working on personal projects and try new stuff, this way I can stay up to date with technology and learn new things.

The articles in this blog document the interesting things I discover during my spare time experiments.

Happy reading!
